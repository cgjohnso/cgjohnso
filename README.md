### Hi there 👋
I'm Chadwick Johnson, and my personal Motto is **Stay Curious!** 
I started my journey in Health Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, and continue to self study. I've spent the last eight years working in healthcare as a health information management professional, and am making the transition to data analytics. Over the years I've developed a passion for data, and gleaning insights from it. I've worked in a variety of settings ranging from community health centers to nursing facilities, and large internationally reknowned academic health systems. I am looking to solve real world problems in healthcare by combining my experience with data anlaytics principals. 

This portfolio is intended to document my path towards continual learning, and showcase my projects, skills, and interests.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my site, and remember to...
