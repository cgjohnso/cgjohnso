### Hi there 👋
I'm Chadwick Johnson, future Health Data Analyst. I've worked in various healthcare roles over the last 8 years, and during that time I've learned that I have a passion for data, and gleaning insights from it. 

This github page is meant to document my continual learning path and showcase my projects, skills and interests.
