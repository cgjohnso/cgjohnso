### Hi there üëã
I'm Chadwick Johnson, future Health Data Analyst. I've spent the last 8 years working in healthcare as a health information management professional, and am making the transition to data analytics. Over the years I've developed a passion for data, and gleaning insights from it. I've worked in a variety of settings ranging from community health centers to nursing facilities, and large internationally reknowned academic health systems. I am looking to solve real world problems in healthcare through combining my experience with data anlaytics principals. I started my journey in the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, and to continue self study.

This github portfolio is intended to document my path towards continual learning, and showcase my projects, skills, and interests.
