### Hi there 👋
I'm Chadwick Johnson. I started my journey in Health Data Analytics through the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, and continue to self study. I've spent the last 8 years working in healthcare as a health information management professional, and am making the transition to data analytics. Over the years I've developed a passion for data, and gleaning insights from it. I've worked in a variety of settings ranging from community health centers to nursing facilities, and large internationally reknowned academic health systems. I am looking to solve real world problems in healthcare through combining my experience with data anlaytics principals. 

This github portfolio is intended to document my path towards continual learning, and showcase my projects, skills, and interests.

### Business Problem

The World Bank has set a goal in its Climate Action Plan 2021-2025 to focus resources on reducing emissions from high CO2 per capita emitting countries. I review the global CO2 emissions dataset to determine if this strategy will have the intended outcomes of reducing global greenhouse gases.

### Results

I loaded the World Bank's CO2 Dataset into Tableau, and created a visualization that segmented countries into categories based on emission levels. A power point was created, and a final analysis of the data was performed via a narrarated presentation that was uploaded to Youtube.
